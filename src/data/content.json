Every year the catalogues of nurseries and kindergartens are published on the website as pdf, and as a parent you spend quite some time, googling every address in your area trying to find if it's located close to you. The backend script parses this PDF files and geocodes all the addresses, exporting a nice-formatted json with only useful information. This json is loaded on front end to Google Map, showing all the locations together with data on the ages of children, operation hours, etc. The app also attempts to search for the page of kindergarten on Facebook, and if it exists, shows some useful information from it."

It also preserves the formatting (e.g. one task - one line), and applies colors to each type of activity, based on simple dictionary."
